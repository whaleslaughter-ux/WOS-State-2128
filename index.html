Whaleslaughter was quick to clarify that the harmony likely stemmed from HAV’s refusal to argue in alliance chat. Observers noted that the peace held for nearly six hours — a new state record — before someone inevitably started talking about 'nonsense' and Whaleslaughter noticed that Dieper was an R4."
