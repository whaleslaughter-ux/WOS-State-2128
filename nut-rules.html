  <h3>Brothers in Arms Rules</h3>
  <p>
    Brothers in Arms is a two-day PvP event where alliances battle by attacking enemy cities & troops.

    Coordinate offense & defense while protecting your own resources.

    <li><strong>Shield or Fight:</strong> If you don’t want to participate, shield up. Stay in your alliance territory.</li>
    <li><strong>City Attacks:</strong> Max <strong>2 attacks per city</strong>; if it’s burning, move on.</li>
    <li><strong>Alliance Structures:</strong> HQs and banners are off-limits.</li>
    <li><strong>Tile Combat:</strong> Resource tiles are fair game.</li>
    <li><strong>No Facility/Bear Interference:</strong> Don’t attack alliances during facility or bear fights.</li>
    <li><strong>Team Strategy:</strong> Group attacks OK within limits.</li>
    <li><strong>Respect Weaker Players:</strong> Attack only within ±3 Furnace levels.</li>
  </ul>

<section id="opt">
  <h3>Opt-Out Information</h3>
  <p>
    Alliances may opt out of NUT by notifying the leadership council.  
    Opting out removes NUT protection — others may engage freely.  
    Make sure it fits your alliance goals first.
